Firebase console

Created Realtime Database
Generated the config code and saved it to put in under environments later.


npm install firebase
ng new Angular13FirebaseCrud
cd Angular13FirebaseCrud

put firebase config under environments
environment.ts
     firebase : {
    apiKey: "xxxx",
    authDomain: "angular13-firebase1.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "angular13-firebase1",
    storageBucket: "angular13-firebase1.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "151997086973",
    appId: "xxx",
    databaseURL:"angular13-firebase1-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app"
  }
databaseURL does not exist on firebase config. 
Need to create Realtime database on firebase console
get the database URL from there and add to environment.ts 

rxjs version - using latest version create compilation error; so had to use an older version
    The issue was in retriving snapshot on the service services/tutorial
angular/firebase - used an older version for safe path; Should try newer version

ng g s services/tutorial
ng g c components/add-tutorial
ng g c components/tutorial-details
ng g c components/tutorials-list
ng g class models/tutorial --type=model

npm install --save firebase
npm install firebase @angular/fire --save
npm install rxjs --save

npm install to install package.json components
run the ng server with ng serve
ng serve
